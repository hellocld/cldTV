# cldTV

A set of scripts and systemd units that turn your pi into an infinite video channel of weirdness.

- Requires omxplayer and `sudo` privileges to install/run

Run `sudo ./install.sh` to copy the scripts and enable the systemd units. It's important to note that right now this whole "package" is what I guess you could call an early beta. Running cldTV.sh from .bashrc does work, and updating the library by running cldTVUpdate.sh works as well, the installer is currently untested and the systemd units don't seem to be working.
